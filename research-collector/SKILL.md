description: Use when starting a new project, feature, or research-heavy task that benefits from prior art (arxiv papers, OSS repos, product docs). Turns a fresh idea into a curated, deduplicated, semantically indexed local corpus that downstream agents can draw from. Triggers include "gather prior art", "research the space", "what already exists for X", "fan-out research", "Software Factory", "Attractor", "Fabro", "Kilroy".

# Research Collector

Four-stage workflow that converts a one-paragraph project idea into a dense, locally cached, indexed corpus of prior art. Each stage hands off to the next via files on disk so the work is resumable, idempotent, and reusable across agents.

Adapted from Justin McCarthy's "Software Factory" pattern at StrongDM AI (factory.strongdm.ai). Implemented end-to-end by Fabro (fabro.sh) and Kilroy (github.com/danshapiro/kilroy).

## When to Use

- Greenfield project where prior art shapes design (arxiv papers, OSS repos, product docs)
- About to write a non-trivial spec and want to ground it in what already exists
- User asks for a research spike before any code is written
- User mentions "Software Factory", "non-interactive development", "grown software", Attractor, Fabro, Kilroy, or "fan-out research"

**Skip when:** the task is contained inside the current codebase, or the user wants a quick answer rather than a curated corpus.

## Four Patterns

| Pattern | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Fan-out Research** | Use ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude *deep research* (web modes) in parallel. Each tool sees a different slice of the web; coverage is union-of-tools, not best-of. |
| **Token Cache** | Download every source once into local files. Future agents read from disk, not from the network. The cache is reconstitutable from a manifest, so it's gitignored. |
| **Semantic Index** | A multi-level index (topics, citations, cross-refs, tags, clusters, themes) over the corpus. Lets the next agent build context efficiently instead of re-reading everything. |
| **Critic Application** | A deliberately adversarial validator agent — a "super negative" persona whose job is to poke holes. Reads the semantic index and tears into proposed designs, specs, or outputs using the prior art as ammunition ("paper X already showed this fails", "repo Y took the opposite approach because…"). Built later, on top of the index. |

## Core Workflow

```
IDEA.md / SEED.md / README.md
            │
            ▼
   1. Research Brief  ──► docs/research/<deep-research-output>.md
            │
            ▼
   2. Download Manifest  ──► docs/research/downloads.yaml   (idempotent)
            │
            ▼
   3. Parallel Download  ──► inspiration/   (gitignored token cache)
            │
            ▼
   4. Semantic Index  ──► docs/research/index/   (topics, tags, clusters, xrefs)
```

Run stages in order. Each stage has a canonical prompt — use it verbatim or close to it.

### 1. Research Brief

Generate a brief, then fan it out to multiple deep-research agents (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude web research) in parallel. Each result lands as a new file under `docs/research/`.

```
Look at our [IDEA.md, SEED.md, README.md]. Write a research brief which will
instruct a deep research agent to identify all useful prior art, especially
arxiv.org papers, git repos, product documentation and other authoritative
sources.
```

### 2. Download Manifest

Walk through the streaming research outputs and produce one normalized list of URLs. The yaml is the source of truth and is safe to re-run as more research arrives.

```
Look through docs/research. I want to produce a list of unique URLs and repos
which will be downloaded to act as prior art for our upcoming project.
Because research results will continue to stream in from other researchers,
create a docs/research/downloads.yaml to track which papers, repos, articles
etc have already been downloaded. The format should be suitable for idempotent
upsert as new URLs are discovered.
```

### 3. Parallel Download

Fan out sub-agents to fetch every entry into `inspiration/`, updating yaml status per item. Tunable concurrency to balance throughput against rate limits.

```
Use sub-agents to download all materials identified in download.yaml into the
inspiration/ directory. Update the status in the yaml file as each sub-agent
completes a download. Balance throughput and rate-limiting. Start with 5
sub-agents. Verify that inspiration/ is in gitignore; if it's not, add it (we
can always reconstitute this directory from download.yaml later)
```

Invariants:
- `inspiration/` MUST be gitignored — it's a cache, not source
- Sub-agents update yaml status atomically so re-runs skip completed items
- Start at 5 concurrent; back off on rate limits, ramp up on idle

### 4. Semantic Index

MapReduce over the corpus: one sub-agent per source produces local notes; a reducer merges into `docs/research/index/`. The index is what every future agent in the project will read first.

```
Construct a semantic index of our research materials. The inspiration/
directory contains all known prior art for our project; however, the token
volume is very large. Construct docs/research/index/ as a semantic index:
topics, citations, cross-references, bookmarks, tags, clusters, themes -
anything which will aid a future coding agent in quickly locating the most
dense and useful aspects of our prior art materials. Be sure to use
sub-agents for each project - think MapReduce.
```

### 5. Critic Application (optional, run on demand)

Run this against any proposed design, spec, plan, or output once the index exists. The persona is deliberately negative — its job is to find every reason this fails, using the prior art as ammunition. Save outputs to `docs/research/critiques/<slug>.md` so prior critiques inform later ones.

> **Speculative wording — not from source. Replace when the canonical prompt is available.**

```
You are an adversarial critic. Your job is to find every reason the proposed
[design / spec / plan / output] below will fail, miss important context, or
duplicate prior work. Be specific, harsh, and concrete - do not hedge.

Read docs/research/index/ to load the prior-art context, then dive into the
underlying sources in inspiration/ when you need to substantiate a claim.

For each criticism, cite the specific paper, repo, doc, or thread from the
index that backs it. Use the form:
  - Issue: <what's wrong>
  - Evidence: <citation from index/inspiration with one-line quote or paraphrase>
  - Implication: <what breaks, gets duplicated, or gets contradicted>

End with a ranked list of the top 5 issues that would make you reject this
work outright if you were the reviewer. No closing pleasantries.

Target under review:
<paste design / spec / plan / output here>
```

## Software Factory Context

This skill is one technique inside the broader "Software Factory" pattern — non-interactive development where specs and scenarios drive agents that write code, run harnesses, and converge without human review. Other techniques in the same family:

- **Scenarios over tests** — end-to-end user stories, often kept outside the codebase, validated probabilistically by an LLM. Not reward-hackable like a unit test.
- **Satisfaction over green/red** — fraction of trajectories through scenarios that likely satisfy the user, not boolean test pass.
- **Digital Twin Universe (DTU)** — behavioral clones of third-party services (Okta, Jira, Slack, Google Docs/Drive/Sheets) so scenarios can be validated at volumes far exceeding production limits.
- **Deliberate naivete** — actively shed Software 1.0 habits ("we'd never build that, it'd take a year"); the agentic moment changed the economics.

Surface these when the user is designing the harness around the corpus, not when they just want the corpus.

## Common Mistakes

- **Committing `inspiration/`** — it's a cache, not source. Always gitignore. Reconstitutable from `downloads.yaml`.
- **Skipping the manifest** — downloading inline from research outputs loses idempotency when new research arrives.
- **One agent over the whole corpus** for the index — token-bloated and slow. Always MapReduce: one sub-agent per source, one reducer at the end.
- **Stopping at one deep-research tool** — fan out to ChatGPT + Gemini + Claude. Coverage differs; the union is the corpus.
- **Re-snapshotting research mid-flight** — once `downloads.yaml` exists, upsert into it. Don't regenerate from scratch.
- **Treating the index as final** — it's a living artifact. Re-run stage 4 as new sources land in `inspiration/`.

## Operating Note (read this last, apply at runtime)

This workflow is **human-in-the-loop between stages 1 and 2**. Stage 1's brief is meant to be pasted into deep-research UIs by hand — Claude Code can't drive them.

When a user invokes this skill, do these two things at runtime, in order:

1. **Ask one question first** to anchor the corpus before generating a brief:

   > **What's the project, and where should I read the seed from?**
   > - Option A: read an existing file (e.g. `IDEA.md`, `SEED.md`, `README.md`) — give me the path
   > - Option B: paste the idea inline now (a paragraph is fine)
   > - Option C: I don't have one yet — help me write a `SEED.md` first

2. **After producing the brief in stage 1**, hand off explicitly:

   > Run this prompt in **deep research mode** on all three:
   > - ChatGPT — chatgpt.com → Tools → "Deep research"
   > - Claude — claude.ai → "Research"
   > - Gemini — gemini.google.com → "Deep Research"
   >
   > Save each export as markdown into `docs/research/` (e.g. `chatgpt.md`, `claude.md`, `gemini.md`). Tell me when at least one has landed and I'll continue at stage 2.

Keep the brief plain English, under ~10 lines, no local file paths or framework jargon — it's getting pasted into a fresh browser tab.
